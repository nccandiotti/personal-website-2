    <p class="about-me-paragraph">
      Hi! My name is Nicole Candiotti, and I am a speech-language pathologist,
      currently located in Central New York with the goal of returning to NYC by
      the end of 2022. In the past five years, I've embarked on a variety of
      educational pursuits, ranging from studying comparative literature in
      Paris, France; communication sciendes and disorders in NYC; a clinical
      fellowship in speech-language pathology at a level 1 trauma center in
      Rochester, New York; and finally, here: studying web development and
      software engineering from my living room in Syracuse, New York by way of
      the Flatiron School. My professional experiences to date have primarily
      focused on assessment and treatment of adults with speech, language,
      cognitive, and swallowing deficits secondary to stroke, traumatic brain
      injury, progressive neurological diseases, old age, post surgical
      complications, cancer, and trauma in acute care and acute inpatient rehab.
      My long term goal is to collaborate with others to create apps that
      improve the lives of individuals with brain injuries, their caretakers,
      and their medical providers. Short term goal: have fun and figure out what
      the heck this software engineering business is all about!
